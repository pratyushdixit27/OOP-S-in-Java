OOPS in JAVA:
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming System in JAVA.

Here one can get the complete knowledge of oops and its 6 main pillars: 1)Object 2) Class/Methods 3) Inheritance 4) Abstraction 5)Encapsulation 6)Polymorphism

Class: Class is a collection of object. It is not a real world entity, it is just a blueprint of an object. It does not occupy space in a memory.

Objects: Object is a real world entity. It occupies memory [Heap] in space. Object is an instance of class. Object consists of : Identity, State/Attribute, Behaviour.

Methods: It is a set of code which performs a particular tasks. The main advantage of method is: Code Reusability, Code Optimization.

Polymorphism: It consists of two words Poly means many and morphism means forms. It refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities. It is of two types: Compile time polymorphism (achieved by Method Overloading) and run time polymorphism(achieved by Method Overriding).
